## ⚙️ Core Architecture  

| Module | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| 🧠 **AI Core** | Central supervised-learning engine using continuous retraining (transfer learning). |
| 💬 **NLP Module** | RNN / Transformer-based model for abusive-language and phishing-text detection. |
| 👁️ **Computer Vision Module** | CNN/ResNet model for identifying forged or AI-generated images and videos. |

## 🔍 Key Features  

### 1️⃣ Securing Communications 🗣️  
Real-time detection of abusive or toxic messages using contextual NLP models that understand tone, intent, and semantics.  
- Pragmatic language understanding  
- Adaptive retraining to learn new slang or code words  
- 10 000 + abusive instances successfully flagged  

### 2️⃣ Fortifying Inboxes 📧  
Phishing & email breach detection through composite AI feature vectors:  
- Header & sender anomaly analysis  
- URL entropy scoring  
- Content-similarity with phishing templates  
- Proactive breach alerts via API integration  

### 3️⃣ Unmasking Deception 📸  
Deepfake and forged-media detection using computer-vision forensics.  
- Frame-consistency & liveness-signature analysis  
- Detection of pixel-level manipulation artifacts  
- Verification tool for user-submitted content
