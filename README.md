## 🔍 Key Features  

### 1️⃣ Abuse langauage 🗣️  
Real-time detection of abusive or toxic messages using contextual NLP models that understand tone, intent, and semantics.  
- Pragmatic language understanding  
- Adaptive retraining to learn new slang or code words  
- 10 000 + abusive instances successfully flagged  

### 2️⃣ Phishing Email Dectection 📧  
Phishing & email breach detection through composite AI analysis vectors:  
- Header & sender anomaly analysis  
- URL entropy scoring  
- Content-similarity withphishingg templates  
- Proactive breach alerts via API integration  

### 3️⃣ AI Generated images detecting📸  
Deepfake and forged-media detection using computer-vision forensics.  
- Frame-consistency & liveness-signature analysis  
- Detection of pixel-level manipulation artifacts  
- Verification tool for user-submitted content
